### The Project
This was our first internal project at the Wild Code School (4 days of code, a week after the beginning of the Bootcamp). The main instruction was to develop **a responsive website** for a fictional photographer.

Technically, the objective was to put into practice what we had learned on **HTML5** and **CSS3**, and to develop these skills.
